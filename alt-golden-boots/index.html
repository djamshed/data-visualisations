      <h1>ANOTHER WAY TO "GOLDEN BOOT"</h1>
      <h2>An attempt to identify goal scorers that contributed the most to a team success in soccer.</h2>
    </header>


    <div class="intro">
      <p>In soccer, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League_Golden_Boot"><i>Golden Boot</i></a>
      is one of the most important individual trophies awarded to a <strong>player</strong> that managed to score the <strong>most goals</strong> during a league season.
      Likewise, <i>Champion</i> is the title awarded to a <strong>team</strong> that earned the most amount of <strong>points</strong> throughout a season.
      Let's repeat it again: individual award â€” for goals, team award â€” for points.</p>
      <p>There is an indirect relationship between the goals and points. If only there was a "translator" from goals to the points,
        we could've ended up with a useful metric that measured player's success on the same scale as teams.
        If patiently scrolled throughout the page, the author will try to explain his (naive, simple, subjective) idea on how we could measure both the team and the player success on the scale that matters the most: by number of points.

              <h3>Use case: Premier League 2008-2009 season</h3>
              <p>This is what an English Premier League table looked like at the end of 2008-2009 season. The <span class="active-stat">#1</span> ranked team - <span class="active-stat">Manchester U</span> - won the league title. Let's look at the anatomy of how a team wins the title.</p>

              <h3>Most <span class="active-stat">POINTS</span> = Champion</h3>
              <p>
                The ultimate metric to identify a champion is the number of <span class="active-stat">POINTS</span> (pts) earned by a team throughout a season. At the end of the season a team with the most points becomes a champion.

              <p>A team wins a game if it scores more goals than its opponent. <span class="active-stat">GOALS FOR</span> (gf) stat in this table is the total number of goals scored by a team throughout the season.</p>
              <p>Some of these goals are "responsible" for points earned than the others. <strong>For each played game, let's attribute team's points to ONE GOAL that is responsible for ALL the POINTS earned by a team in that game.</strong></p>

              <p>If a team won a game, it is awarded three points. Now, the objective is to find a goal that secured those points.</p>
              <p>For the purpose of this analysis, let's attribute the winning team's <strong>three points to the goal that ensured the victory</strong>: the goal scored to put the winning team in the lead (similar to ice hockey's definition of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_(ice_hockey)">game winning goal</a>).

                Defoe and Lampard are ahead of everyone.
                Although Defoe scored only 11 goals, his team benefited
                from his six game-winning and one game-tying goals.
                That is 19 points, that makes him tie for the first place
